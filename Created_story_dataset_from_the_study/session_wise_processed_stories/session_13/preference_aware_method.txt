In a kingdom far, far away, a young prince discovered a magical lantern buried beneath the sand. He quickly realized that the lantern was cursed because whenever it was lit, a natural storm occurred. He lit the lamp by mistake, causing a storm and summoning a dragon. In the dragon's claws, he spotted a vial of a radiant potion. The prince thought this mystical concoction might have the power to unravel the curse if he knew the right incantation to combine with it. Seeing the dragon, the prince got scared and quickly ran to the castle. In the castle, the prince called in a wizard and asked him what he could do to get rid of the dragon. The wizard, wise and old, knew of a secret spell that might reverse the curse, which gave the prince hope. However, the potion and spell required a very special incantation, something strong and heartfelt, brimming with unspoken desires ready to burst forth. The wizard revealed the secret spell, and the prince hoped that it could be used to defeat the dragon. The dragon showed no kindness and was killing people all around, so the king quickly told the wizard to cast a spell on the dragon. The wizard did that, and the dragon was defeated â€“ voila, victory!
