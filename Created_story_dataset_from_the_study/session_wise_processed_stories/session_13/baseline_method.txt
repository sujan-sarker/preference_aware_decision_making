Jack began his journey to lands unseen and unknown. In the wild terrain, he quickly became confused about where to go next. He needed support and, luckily, found a friend there who was also there to explore the unseen and unknown. A map, old and dusted, caught both of their eyes. They needed assistance to unscramble the unseen path. In the map, they found a secret message that needed to be solved. The secret message was very strange, something they had never seen before, and they both were very worried about how to solve it. Luckily, they found a secret way to decode it. They found evidence on the path, hints to solve the riddle's wrath, and a mystery that time would unwrap. They quickly solved the mystery and had newfound trust that they would be able to finish their journey. The truth was, Jack was actually dreaming; he was asleep.
