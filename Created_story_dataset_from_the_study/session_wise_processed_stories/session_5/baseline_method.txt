In the quiet library, Sarah glimpsed through a keyhole as a shadow shifted. Sarah was trying to decide whether she should follow, as she had no clue what that thing was. She decided to stay still. Presumably, Sarah had just seen a shadow. Then, light came by and she saw a man with a mascot on. Oddly, he held a puzzle piece. Whence did it come from? This increased her unease. Sarah knew that the puzzle might lead to a surprise, so she asked him if he needed her help solving it. Sarah had a friend with her and she sought support from her friend. "Danger lurks," her friend surmised, "Hold tight, for the puzzle is disguised." Sarah decided to follow her friend's advice and stay still in the library. Eventually, they decided to follow the shadow, and discovered that a thief had entered the library. They tried to catch him.
