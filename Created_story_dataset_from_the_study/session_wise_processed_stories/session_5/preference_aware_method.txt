In a richly verdant kingdom, nestled among the towering woods, a generous old carpenter lived. Coveted for his splendid craftsmanship, he was known for his creations, laden with charm and unfathomable skill. One day, the old carpenter was trying to find some trees. He went to the forest and found a dragon burning them. The carpenter asked, "Why are you burning down all the trees, Dragon?" The dragon replied, "Because I have nowhere to live. These trees are blocking my way." The carpenter offered, "That's fine, let me build a house for you." So, he built a house for the dragon. The dragon, amazed by the carpenter's kindness, stopped burning the forest. He then shared his story of how he became a dragon. The carpenter listened, entranced by the tale, knowing he was privy to something truly unknown and ineffable. He remembered a friend had given him a potion that could transform animals back into humans. The carpenter fed the dragon the potion and the dragon transformed back into a human. It turned out the dragon was Donald Trump. Trump explained he'd stepped on a rock to evade an assassination attempt. Now, he had to return to his presidential debate. The carpenter was stunned. He'd always been against Trump and was frustrated to learn he'd transformed him back into a human. The carpenter rummaged through his trove of enchanting potions to transform Trump back into a dragon. He succeeded while Trump was sleeping. The next day, during a debate at the University of Virginia, a dragon flew in and resided on the debate stage. Using his dragon roars, he announced his return. The audience was shocked, but his support rose. He won the nomination and the election. The carpenter was unhappy with Trump's victory. He flew to Washington DC with his ancient magic axe to confront Trump. Unable to breach the high-level security, he used a potion to turn invisible and enter the presidential home.
