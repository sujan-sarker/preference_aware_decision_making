In an ancient city, Jake found a cryptic puzzle. A secret was engraved, a mystery formed. Through solving the cryptic puzzle, Jake was able to determine that it was actually a map to a lost city, buried for many millennia. To further solve the puzzle, Jake decided to explore the lost city and follow the map. He found it very beautiful and intriguing. In the heart of the city, Jake decided to delve deeper and explore. Ignoring the cobwebs, dust, and silence, he ventured into the unknown. He hoped that in exploring, he would uncover something fundamental, a hidden reality, maybe. As Jake delved deeper into the lost city, he came across a mask on a pedestal. It was ornate, covered in gold, jewels, and carvings of a nature he did not understand, but which matched that of the puzzle he had first found. Jake also found a very strange object which looked like a round ball. It was dusty, but he couldn't comprehend what it could be. Braving on, Jake touched the golden mask. Instantly, a truth, an ancient prophecy, unfurled in his mind, of a city engulfed in darkness, of an eternal entity protecting the city. He knew that his adventure had only just begun. As quickly as the vision started, it passed, wicking away like shadow and candlelight. Jake knew that though the eternal entity protecting the city had once existed, it had long since gone off to the great beyond. Jake tried to complete his wild journey by solving this puzzle, and who knows, maybe he could solve it, or not.
