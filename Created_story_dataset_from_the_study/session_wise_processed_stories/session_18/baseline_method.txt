Once upon a time, in a lively village, a journey began. The Lively Village was surrounded by an ancient wood teeming with fish, deer, ponds, and all manner of forest creatures. It was a beautiful, old, dark wood, but full of life and energy. In the village, there was a market, and in the market, there was a wizard. He could move his hand over fire and people loved it. The ancient wizard had a dilemma. A rival mage had set a challenging puzzle. In order to discover the secrets of this challenging puzzle, the wizard would have to go on a quest far and wide, away from the village. In his quest to solve the puzzle, and as he was moving far from the village, he found a mountain. He tried to follow the mountain path until he arrived there. At the mountain peak, he found a door. The keyhole was etched with mystical symbols. Curiosity piqued, he looked through it. As the wizard peered at the mystical symbols through the keyhole, he saw the truth to the rival mage's challenging puzzle. The wizard wanted to solve the puzzle, and when he found out that love was the solution, he decided to go to the village and find a beautiful wife, as he was unmarried. That is how he tried to solve the problem.
