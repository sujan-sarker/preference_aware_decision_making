In Beaverland, Earl and Bob collaborate to build a dam, sharing tasks. The goal of Earl and Bob is to find the treasure hidden somewhere. Despite the difficulty of their task, they believe that if they work actively together, they will be able to reach their goal and find the treasure. The journey starts when Earl and Bob meet each other at a bar. They were talking about a treasure map they had seen in a book. "Got the map?" Earl asks. "Yep, let's assist each other," responds Bob. The map shows a few possible locations for the treasure: one is the mountain, another is the desert, and the last one is the beach. "How about we start with the mountain?" Earl suggests. They check all the routes together on the map, looking for the best way to proceed. "Need help climbing, Earl?" Bob offers. "With teamwork, the peak is ours," Earl smiles. They start following the trail to the mountain. Although the route requires some climbing, they eventually reach the top of the mountain. They overcome all dangers, but once they reach the top, they find a smiley face on the cliff. Realizing this is a scam, they question the authenticity of the map.
