Story 1:
Through the old mansion's keyhole, young Jake spied an eerie glow. It was a secret mansion deep in the forest, and Jake had never been there before. However, he decided to stay and see what was going on. Jake noticed that the door to the mansion was open, so he decided to discover what was inside the mansion and went inside. In the dusty, candlelit study, a cryptic puzzle caught Jakeâ€™s eye. After spending some time carefully solving the puzzle, Jake realized that the puzzle actually showed a map. Jake, feeling bored, decided to follow the map. Since the starting point on the map was the kitchen, he decided to go there. In the kitchen, shadows danced, and Jake's heartbeat surged as he became entranced. Jake tried to see what was going on in the kitchen, but he didn't realize that he was being followed by another shadow. He decided to follow the shadow back instead, and the shadow decided to lead him to the basement. What happened to Jake will forever remain a mystery.

Story 2:
In a realm of enchantment, a fellowship of brave hearts set out on a quest. They carried peculiar relics, twinkling strangely in the moonlight. They had been sailing for a long time to reach this isolated island deep in the ocean, and their goal was singular: they were seeking a potion that would grant them eternal life. From what they could tell, there was a witch on this island who possessed that potion. Upon landing, they felt a surprising surge of magic pervading the air. Yet around them, not enchantments or spellbound creatures, but rather mundane flora and fauna seemed to thrive. At this point, they could only trust their own capabilities, so they carefully marched towards the center of the island. At the center of the island, there was a huge castle. They decided to go inside and try their luck at finding the witch. As the fellowship explored deeper into the castle, they stumbled upon another traveler. This wanderer was lost, seeking shelter, and asked to join their crew. Noticing his gaze constantly straying towards the towering height reaching into the skies, they felt an unspoken understanding about their next destination. The fellowship talked to the traveler and surprisingly found that all three of them shared the same goal. They decided to walk together and climb the mountain together, despite the journey ahead being extremely dangerous. The final question became: would they risk their lives in exchange for immortality?
