Beneath a moonlit sky, two detectives made a mysterious discovery. It was a very dark night when the incident occurred. Even in this darkness, they found that far from their island, a mysterious light was pulsing, which was not supposed to be in that position. The secret light pulsed eerily, an unknown source that defied believability. From their university, they started to follow the secret light and went towards the island to see what was actually happening. After following the light for a while, they decided to journey by boat to the island to discover what this mysterious thing actually was. Barely knowing each other's strength, trust bound them tight in the sprawling depth. The reason for this was because both of these adventurous people had a common interest. The common interest was to find out where the secret light was coming from. They successfully sorted out what the light was, and this discovery, along with the journey to the wild, made their bond lifelong and strong.
