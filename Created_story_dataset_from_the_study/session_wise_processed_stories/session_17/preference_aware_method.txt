In a bustling city, a young boy named Sam decided to join the local baseball team. He was eager, albeit slightly anxious, to contribute to the team's success. To prove that he could successfully collaborate with his teammates, he was ready to undertake an adventurous journey with them. This was also because he was hoping to get an athletic scholarship for his college degree. To show his commitment, Sam stayed late after practice one day, eager to help the team perfect their techniques. He believed that in order to succeed, everyone needed to rely on each other's strengths. So, one day, when he was returning home after finishing his late practice session, he saw a very wild animal in the road that had just passed before him. He recognized the animal as a mountain lion, which was not supposed to be in the forest area where he resided. So, he was a bit anxious thinking about where it had come from. Realizing his teammates might be in danger too, Sam decided to lead a discussion about the mountain lion. He believed their experience as a baseball team could help them tackle unusual challenges, even those lurking beyond the field's lights. His baseball team believed his story and informed the other people in the local area about the mountain lion. The local people, along with his baseball teammates, formed a team to alert everyone about this mountain lion and decided to be cautious when passing through this forest area.
