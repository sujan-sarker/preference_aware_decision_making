In the heart of Magic Woods, two children, Cara and Kai, discovered a glow. It was a great love to see that glow, but at the same time, it was a very adventurous journey for them. "Let's explore these magic woods together. Now it's your turn," they followed the glow and found an obelisk with a crystal in the middle. When they touched the crystal, a vision of a Great Hall appeared right in front of them. Suddenly, the crystal pulsed, and magic surged. "Speak a wish," a voice urged. "Do you think about the wish? I guess I want to explore more. So let's see how far we can go and explore the magic world together in this adventurous call," replied one. "You are correct. We should not be randomly listening to crystals as they asked us to answer their wishes. It could be a trick or crap. Instead, in that same vision, we saw a forest that we once visited. Let's go and revisit that place." Suddenly, they heard a roar. A dragon, majestic yet fierce, appeared. "Help me," it pleaded. "Yeah, we can help, but I've got fear in me. It's a dragon; it's a little bit scary for me, so can we think of something else?" Thanks to plot armor, Kai had a polymorph potion in his pocket. He threw it at the dragon. Shaking, the polymorph potion turned the dragon into a mouse, and that gave them enough time to run away and escape.
