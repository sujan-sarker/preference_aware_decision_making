In a sleepy town, children came together, each with a silent, hopeful expression. Each held something dear to their hearts. I think they wanted to explore the wizard in town together. It might be their favorite thing to explore. The wizard was wise, and they wished that he could answer why they held those things in their hearts. The group decided to follow the map left by the wizard. As they journeyed together, their steps in unison embodied a profound bond, blossoming further with each step. Their unity brought a sense of reassurance and reliance upon each other. As they continued their quest, their eyes gleamed, a quiet testament to their shared ambition. They were one step closer to finding the answers their hearts desired. Gradually, they were going to the mountain, and then all of a sudden, they found an interesting thing. They were a little bit scared to see it but were very eager to explore more. They found a rundown castle, and outside the castle was the wizard's horse. This confused them, for the map did not say anything about a castle. Could they actually trust the wizard more? The unexpected sight of the forgotten castle did not deter them; their fellowship was unbroken. They calmly huddled together, sharing courage from their collective strength. Tomorrow promised intriguing answers as the old brickwork awaited their eager touch. They were addressing the wizard, but they were still a bit confused about whether they should follow him or not. In the magical world, they were getting lost and at the same time, trusting the wizard. They ventured into the castle, and at the end of their journey, they came to a loss. It was the wizard, dead, decaying as if he had been dead for days. All their hopes and dreams were crushed. Without the wizard, how could they ever find the answers?
