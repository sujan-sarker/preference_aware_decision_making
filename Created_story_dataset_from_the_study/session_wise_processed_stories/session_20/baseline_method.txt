In the bustling cityscape, Robo and Nano assist each other. As they join together they help each other in their joined adventure. Many important things are made in the world, but they were poor, so they always thought of getting hold of any treasure to make themselves rich. One day, while sitting underneath a big mountain, they started thinking about how to get hold of a razor. Their journey for riches began, over hills and deep within. Guided by teamwork, they trusted their wings. They found that there were some unknown mystery books in the library, and in those books there were maps of treasures. So they started to think about how to get them and made a plan to visit the library to get the books and search for the unknown treasures. In a book in the library, they saw that there exists a treasure in the basement of a castle, but only someone who has six fingers on his left hand can get hold of that razor. In the deep blue gloom, they discovered an ancient map that no creature could recover. Against all odds, their faith would never waver. They planned to find the castle, even if it was in the deep forest. They decided they would eventually find it. They promised each other they would never stop until they found it. But suddenly, they saw the ceiling of the library and there was written that it was the fiction section, so they understood that these books were all fictional and there was no truth behind them. Disappointed, Robo and Nano went back to their work. They left without the magic potion of becoming rich and kept on being the same as they were before.
