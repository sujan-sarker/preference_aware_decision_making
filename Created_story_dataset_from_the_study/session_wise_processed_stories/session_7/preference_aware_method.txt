In a realm brimming with magic, a young princess pondered over the secret woven into her golden locket by a witch. She approached her father, the king, to open it, but he couldn't, so he entrusted it to a wizard. The wizard opened the locket using a spell the princess had never heard before, warning her of its dangerous and mysterious contents. Overwhelmed, the princess sought solitude in the castle's highest tower. She noticed an old tapestry depicting an enchantress weaving spells and saw a spell of smoke coming from a distant mountain. Curious, she decided to chase the smoke, but it felt like a never-ending run. Suddenly, a shadow appeared, reprimanding her for opening the locket. She unraveled the tapestry, revealing a hidden puzzle of secret symbols and enchanted emblems. Determined, she decided to learn these spells. Rather than chasing the smoke, she returned to the castle. She opened the locket and commanded the shadow to leave. Suddenly, a beam of light surrounded her, and she disappeared mysteriously.
