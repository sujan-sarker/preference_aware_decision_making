In a world untouched, two friends dared to explore with hearts full of bold curiosity. They decided to go treasure hunting on an unknown island, a journey that required a 48-hour boat ride. On a sunny day, they packed their boat with everything they needed for their journey, including a printed map of the island. However, they forgot their food at home, so they had to make a stop elsewhere. As they journeyed, the weather worsened; a storm was approaching, and the water levels were rising. Amidst the chaos, they spotted an old, forsaken cabin on an island. As they neared the cabin, they noticed lights, which made them reconsider their path. Suddenly, a scary-looking man emerged from the cabin and warned them of lurking danger. The friends opened their map in search of a safe place, but found none. They decided to face their fate and approach the man. Suddenly, they noticed a dark opening in the mountain. With their food supply depleted, they decided to explore this new path.
