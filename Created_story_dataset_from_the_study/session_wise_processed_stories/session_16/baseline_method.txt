In a forgotten kingdom, a wizard had the ability to transform anything. He yearned to become the most powerful person in the kingdom and tried to find a spell to achieve this. However, the spell remained a puzzle, as he couldn't figure out how to cast it. Determined, he set out to explore the kingdom in search of anyone who could help him with his task. On his journey, he discovered a mystical forest known only in legend. Upon stepping inside the mystical forest, a map appeared in front of him, promising to guide him to the solution to his problems. While exploring the forest, he encountered a gnome who promised to help him become the most powerful person in the kingdom, but only if he could answer the gnome's riddle. The gnome's riddle held the key to the spell he sought and with it, the power he'd accrue. The wizard, being very smart, answered the gnome's riddle with ease. Consequently, the gnome decided to help him. As they descended deeper into the forest, their encounters grew wilder. This led the wizard to question why he even wanted to become the most powerful person in the first place. After several near-death experiences in the forest, the wizard learned the truth of the gnome's intentions, which were to try and defeat the wizard and steal all of his spells. With this revelation, he cast a spell, escaped the forest, and continued on his journey to become the most powerful in the kingdom.
