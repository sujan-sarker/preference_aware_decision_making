Aloof on an island, Jim found a map. The map, "Lakeway Ancient Razor Deepak," led to a trailer that housed a big dragon intent on killing anyone who passed. With the map glowing, he transformed into a knight. Confronting the dragon, his heart raced. The magic spell that turned him into a knight made him a brave soldier. He fought the dragon with every ounce of his strength and a big sword, but despite his bravery, the dragon emerged victorious. However, the dragon was not the only obstacle. There were more magic spells that needed to be broken before he could proceed. He found a potion and drank it. Revived, he now thought about his impending victory. Triumphantly, he acquired all the riches in the world, but he yearned for love. He wished to find the love of his life, but love couldn't be found through any spell, so he remained lonely.
