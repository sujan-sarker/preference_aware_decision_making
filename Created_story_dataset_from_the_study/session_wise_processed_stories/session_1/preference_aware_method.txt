In a realm of the forgotten, where danger lingered like a shadow, two brave explorers tread lightly. An ancient prophecy spoke of a change, a drastic alteration, should they survive these ominous lands. The prophecy told them that their journey would lead them to brighter, happier days, and their suffering would end if they could find the hidden treasure. The map to the treasure was hidden behind a gift located in a Fire Mountain, so they began their journey to find the map that would guide them to the treasure. Their hopes hinged on a single thread of magic, a mysterious incantation said to awaken the Fire Mountain. Wrapped in enigmatic whispers, it was believed to cause an extraordinary shift, reshaping what was deemed impossible. Through the forest they journeyed, days turned into nights, and after a long trek, they reached their destination. Just as they approached the mountain, a wizard appeared who wanted to trick the travelers. The challenge was not easy because it took the form of a riddle. As they navigated the perilous paths of Fire Mountain, their trust in each other deepened. The daunting ascent was filled with tests, but the bond of unwavering devotion between them unknowingly grew stronger. The wizard transformed them into goats, intending to sacrifice them for the love of his life. However, the wizard's plan was unsuccessful. He didn't truly love his partner; his only love was for the travelers' misery, which only made their lives more difficult.
