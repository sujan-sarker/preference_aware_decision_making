In a nearby kingdom, a wizard lived alone. He used to pretend that he loved everyone, but deep inside, he didn't. He had a mask that he would wear at night to go out and find people who were alone. He would torture them and cast black magic on them, finding pleasure in their suffering. One day, the wizard stumbled upon a recipe for a love potion. Intrigued, he decided to brew it. He was hoping that this potion could solve many of his problems. He attempted to start making the potion, but he didn't have all the necessary ingredients. So, he planned to go out. He took his keys, opened the door, and ventured out to gather the necessary items. The ancient recipe called for rare herbs. With excitement, he began his search. He ventured through a jungle, aware of the wild animals within but not caring. He was only thinking about making the potion. After a while, he was able to gather all the herbs he needed. He successfully brewed the potion after a couple of trials. He then made a girl drink the potion which made her fall in love with him. However, after a few days, the magic of the potion wore off, and the girl began to despise the wizard. This taught the wizard that love cannot be forced; it has to be earned.
