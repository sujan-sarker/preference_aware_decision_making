In a town wrapped in mist, the Unknown lived, veiled in a crypt. Not much was known about the Unknown, for it lived in a lot of fog. It liked to hide in the night, and its only known activity was kidnapping people seemingly at random. The people who lived in the fog knew a big secret that nobody living outside of the fog should have known. The people who got kidnapped were the descendants of the fog people, but nobody knew that. In the shadow of rumors, fear grew. Is the next one kidnapped, me or you? In search of answers, a young boy ventured into the darkness to find the Unknown. He was wearing a mask, for there was a rumor that wearing a mask would hide him from the fog and thus keep him safe from being kidnapped by the Unknown. The young boy did not know about the danger he was about to encounter because there were many things left unsaid about this mask that he had just put on. Our journey begins, into the abyss. Can we unveil the fog's cryptic kiss? Unbeknownst to the boy and everyone else, the boy found a map that included the locations of the Unknown. Until now, the Unknown was not a single entity, but multiple. With this information, the boy decided to go back to the town to inform everyone else about this information. Truth be told, the townspeople finally told the young boy that the Unknown came from a long generation of his family and because of that, he had to leave the city. Many years later, the Unknown came back but in a new form because there was a different generation.
