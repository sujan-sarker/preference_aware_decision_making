In the town of Serenity, mysterious Unknown letters appeared. These letters had been coming in from ancient times; nobody knew who they were from or to whom they belonged, but they kept coming. The letters appeared in the form of engravings on the stones at the island. Who did these engravings was not known, yet the town people kept looking for who does it.The Riddle of the Stones, they called it. A cryptic challenge that baffled the town. Usually the letters contained symbols that had no meaning. But then one day, a letter came that had things written on it which could be read. The message said it was still too hard for people to actually read what was there because it was very very tiny, but people knew that solving this could lead to treasure. There were two simultaneous mysteries the townspeople were trying to solve: one, what the messages meant, and two, where they came from. They did not realize which one of the mysteries was more worth solving. A journey to unravel truths, said the mayor, rallying the town. The letters, a map between roots. Many decades passed but the riddles were not solved. As days went by, people grew more and more tired of this riddle. At the same time, the mayor kept spending more and more tax money to address the situation. But this was never solved, so one day all the people got extremely angry and decided to get rid of the mayor. They all went into his office and said, enough with this nonsense. Next time the letters are delivered we will catch the postman and ask that person to never enter this town again. With the mayor now gone, the letters stopped showing up, and so the answer was simple: it was the mayor hiding those letters around the island and using the tax money for personal use, making it look like it was for the Riddle of the Stones.
