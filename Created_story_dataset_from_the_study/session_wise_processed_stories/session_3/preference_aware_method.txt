On a sunlit day, a team of players gathered to brainstorm a novel game strategy. The game's most important component was the result or goal, and it involved a wizard. They started devising a strategy, pondering how they could create a new game from this concept. They agreed on several steps and rules to maintain the game, but couldn't agree on several characters. The wizard was the main character, but he needed supporting characters. So, they decided to hold a meeting to discuss what these characters should be. They pondered a curse for the wizard, proposed by one of the team members. A curse bound to nature, making him incredibly vulnerable to a certain element of the earth. Surprisingly, the wizard would be incredibly vulnerable to wood, which would reduce his powers significantly. Next, they decided to give the wizard a partner, who would help the wizard navigate through his curse and vulnerability to wood. The partner, crafted from the same wooden element, would assist the wizard in navigating these vulnerabilities. The team's next task was to hold a particular gathering. They thought they should create new players for the game, a wizard and his partner who would help him through his journey. But they also needed another player, another creature, which would affect the wizard. They found common ground on the story and planned to play the game. There were multiple characters, like the wizard, his partner, who had a curse, and the common rules were also established. Now, they were only waiting to sit together and play the game.
