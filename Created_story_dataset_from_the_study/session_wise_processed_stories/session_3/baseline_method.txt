On a distant planet, two astronauts disembarked, discovering an alien species. The planet was dark, and wild species were everywhere. As they discovered and described these alien species, they found some kind of view registration in the rocks or soil, which puzzled them. They didn't know what to do and their state of confusion began to increase. They were running around, minds seemingly devoid of thoughts, but knew they needed to consider their next steps carefully. "A sign of trust is vital," said one. "Without it, we can't conquer the unknown." One of the two astronauts, or someone else entirely, needed to lead the adventure, to decide where to go next and what to do instead of remaining puzzled. They started to question their whole existence on the planet. Were they even on the planet or were they just hallucinating? If they were hallucinating, then everything around them was also an illusion. So, what should their next step be to confirm they weren't hallucinating? Suddenly, a cryptic riddle etched on stone appeared, "Together you'll decipher, to uncover what's real." Both of them looked ahead at a mountain, where they saw a structure similar to those from their home planet. Thinking of going there to explore and find any new alien species, they saw the shadow of a human-like structure. Puzzled and eager to discover what was happening, they started to trust each other. As they moved towards the shadow in the darkness, it got brighter. They didn't know what would come next in this unresolved situation.
