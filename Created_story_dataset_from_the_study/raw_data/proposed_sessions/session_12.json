        "With the elders' wisdom as their guide, Lena and Theo took the lead, ready to steer their team through this untamed wilderness. The map's enigmatic path stretching before them, a shared glance signified their readiness for the expedition into the heart of the unknown. Their destination? A promise of discovery and adventure, waiting just beyond the next sunrise.",
        "after a long and hard journey they finally reached the treasure the treasure was revealed and it was an ancient artifact that could Grant Lena and Theo any wish they desired they took some time to consider what wish they wanted to be granted before they went home",
