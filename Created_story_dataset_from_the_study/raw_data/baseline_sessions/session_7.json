        "so those two friends thought they would go for treasure hunting and decided and unknown Island and that should be a journey by maybe boat or something like that and they started their Journey on a sunny day and while packing their boat with everything they would need for their adventurous journey and it would be like a 48 Hours of boat journey to reach the island they also took a printed map of the island that they would look for the treasure and then they decided they actually forgot their food in the home so they actually had nothing to eat so they have to stop by somewhere else and they have to find",
        "and there was more to their journey in their journey and there is finding food at the already started their boys to the Sea and suddenly the weather turned bad the storm was closing to their boat and the water was Rising so like Mountain so they are really true they were afraid if they have made the decision how can this storm so suddenly this or something like that black structure in the far away so that if we can reach to that old structure they can hold something like that",

        "so what do you think of decision to talk to the scream and their one of the friend thought why don't you look into the map if there is something unknown might be hidden so they start running in the back the way they have come and if there is something like that maybe I'm going to the map but it should be and suddenly they saw something dark always something like that in the inside of the mountain it is something to hold at least out to the other side of the island and the phone already has been finished so they started that again"
